This instructional guide will show exactly how we can install the ROS Moveit
packages, as well as all the tutorials that come with it that show how we can
also edit the instructions via rospy.

DEPENDENCIES:
1) Ensure ROS is installed, and that the packages are up to date.
   'rosdep update'
   'sudo apt update'
   'sudo apt dist-upgrade'

2) Install catkin, which is used to build workspaces in ROS.
   'sudo apt install ros-distro-catkin python3-catkin-tools python3-osrf-pycommon'

3) Install wstool (meaning workspace tool)
   'sudo apt install python3-wstool'

Now the dependencies are covered, we can focus on actually installing MoveIt.

1) Set up a new workspace directory for the MoveIt resources, and use wstool to
   merge and construct the foundations of the workspace.
   'mkdir -p ~/moveit_ws/src'
   'cd ~/moveit_ws/src'

   'wstool init .'
'wstool merge -t . https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros-planning/moveit/master/moveit.rosinstall'
   'wstool remove moveit_tutorials' # this line will be cloned later
   'wstool update -t .'

2) For our purposes, we will want the MoveIt configuration files especially for
   the Franka Emika panda arm. Any git clone errors can be safely ignored at
   this point.
   'cd ~/moveit_ws/src' if not in the directory
   'git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials.git -b master'
   'git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/panda_moveit_config.git -b distro-devel'

3) We can now begin making the workspace itself. Start by installing any 
   dependencies via rosdep that are not already inside the workspace:
   'cd ~/moveit_ws/src'
   'rosdep install -y --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro distro'

4) Configure the catkin workspace. Note: do NOT replace the ${ROS_DISTRO} part.
   Much like the Panda Simulator Catkin build, close as many apps as physically
   possible before building. This process will take roughly 15 minutes.

   Make sure you are in the '~/moveit_ws' directory,
   and NOT '~/moveit_ws/src'. Perhaps do 'cd ..' if necessary.

   'cd ~/moveit_ws'
   'catkin config --extend /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO} --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release'
   'catkin build'

5) Source the newly made moveit_ws workspace in the .bashrc file.
   Note: You can source AS MANY WORKSPACES AS YOU WANT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE.
   'source ~/moveit_ws/devel/setup.bash'
