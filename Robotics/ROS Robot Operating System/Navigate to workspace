There is an extremely super quick way to navigate to your main workspace, and
from there to the sandbox, ultimately to any package you like. 
Note that we must have already made the new workspace and changed the source 
for this to work (just follow the tutorial on it).

Commands:
'roscd'
'cd sandbox'
