This tutorial covers how we can 'roslaunch' to START ROS NODES that have been
defined inside a LAUNCH FILE.

Syntax:
roslaunch [package] [filename.launch]

1) Navigate to our beginner_tutorials package using roscd.

2) Make a new directory in this beginner_tutorials directory. We shall call this
   new directory launch.

3) Let us make a launch file that will make two different turtlesim environments
   turtlesim1 and turtlesim2. This will be called 'turtlemimic.launch', where 
   the file extension being launch is very important. I will not write the 
   source code here, instead I shall include it as a separate file in the same
   directory as this tutorial.

   The .launch file will have turtlesim2 copy any and all inputs given to 
   turtlesim1. These launch files are written using XML metadata formatting.

4) Now let us open 3 terminals, with the terminals running the following:
   T1 - roscore
   
   T2 - roslaunch beginner_tutorials turtlemimic.launch
   Note that for T2 we're NOT using rosrun this time! We launch instead with the
   launch file.

   T3 - rostopic pub /turtlesim1/turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -r 1 -- '[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, -1.8]'
   Which should "hopefully" tell both turtles to move in a circle! Actually more
   accurately it tells turtlesim1, but turtlesim2 is mimicking any outputs 
   coming from turtlesim1 so they shall both be doing the same actions.
