This set of instructions covers how we can make ROS packages within the ROS
workspace we made inside another tutorial. If a ROS workspace with sandbox has
not been made yet, please make that first.

1) Navigate to our sandbox inside ROSworkspace.

2) Make a new package using roscreate-pkg. This takes the following format:
'roscreate-pkg packageName [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]' etc...

In this tutorial, we will call our package beginner_tutorials, and the 
dependencies we will use will be std_msgs, rospy, and roscpp. This will be:
'roscreate-pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp'.

3) Inside the package we have made, there will be a manifest.xml document. This
provides vital metadata for developers to read with respect to the package. It
contains information such as whom the maintainer is, what license is used, and
a solid description about the package.
Note: A rule of thumb if you're not told otherwise is to use BSD as the license.

4) If any changes like this are made to the path, call the 'rospack profile'
command.
To ensure that the new directory can now be found, use:
'rospack find beginner_tutorials'.

Note: These dependencies rospy and roscpp are CLIENT LIBRARIES that ALLOW
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH ROS.
