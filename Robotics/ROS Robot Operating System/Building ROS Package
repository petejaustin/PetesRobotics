Building a ROS package you have made is far easier than creating it, or even
any of the steps that we have done thus far with setting up ROS.

1) Navigate to our sandbox using 'roscd' and 'cd sandbox'.

2) Using the format 'rosmake packageName', we can build the package as well as 
   the dependencies.

3) Although outside of the scope of this tutorial, we can build several packages
   at once using the format 'rosmake package1 package2 package3...'

For this example, we shall be using rosmake on beginner_tutorials.
