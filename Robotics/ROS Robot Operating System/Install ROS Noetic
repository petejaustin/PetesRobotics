Step by step guide on how to install ROS Noetic (can easily be manipulated to
apply for any newer versions):

1) Set up your computers to accept software from packages.ros.org.
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

2) Set up your keys.
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -

3) Ensure Debian package index is up to date. WITHOUT THIS IT WILL NOT WORK!
sudo apt update

4) Now we can finally install the ROS Noetic version! This full install will
include everything we could possibly need.
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full

5) There is a script we must source in every Bash terminal we want to use ROS in.
Of course this means we can just add the following script to our .bashrc file.
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

6) So that we can MAKE ROS WORKSPACES AND SANDBOXES, let us also download 
rosinstall.
sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall
