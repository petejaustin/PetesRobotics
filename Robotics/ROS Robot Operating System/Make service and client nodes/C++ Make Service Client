This tutorial covers how to write a simple service and a client inside C++. 

1) We will create a service named 'add_two_ints_server', which receives two ints
   as input and returns the sum of them. In a previous service tutorial we will
   have already made an 'AddTwoInts.srv' file, which we will be calling inside
   our source code file.

2) Like with the publisher and subscriber tutorial, we will be directly copying
   and pasting the server and client code into .cpp files that shall be stored
   in the src directory. Not as many comments are provided this time round,
   however the code is straightforward enough to gather the intuition simply by
   reading it.

   Copy the service code into 'add_two_ints_server.cpp',
   and client code into 'add_two_ints_client.cpp'.
   Put these in the src directory.

3) Navigate to the CMakeLists.txt file inside our beginner_tutorials directory,
   and add the following two lines to the bottom:
   'rosbuild_add_executable(add_two_ints_server src/add_two_ints_server.cpp)'
   'rosbuild_add_executable(add_two_ints_client src/add_two_ints_client.cpp)'

4) In a terminal once navigated to the beginner_tutorials directory, use the
   'make' command to build the service and client nodes.

5) Open 3 terminals in order to ready up running the process.
   i)   In T1, run roscore.
   ii)  In T2, run 'rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_server'.
   iii) In T3, run 'rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_client x y', where we
        will REPLACE x and y with any 2 int values we want to add together.

6) To close the processes, ctrl-c the server and then ctrl-c roscore.
