Finding out about the many ROS topics running and how to get their data:

1) Run 'rostopic list' to list all the topics running

2) To test what grabbing the data from one would print, run the syntax: 
   'rostopic echo <topic found using rostopic list>'. This may run infinitely so
   you'll have to stop the command with ctrl c

3) To see what data type is used through msgs, we use the syntax
   'rostopic type <topic>'. This will return the class of object returned.

4) Now we have the name of the msg class, we can look further into the data
   structure. 
   'rosmsg show <message found>'.

5) We now have everything we need to extract the data into proper structures.
   In the same directory as this tutorial I have provided a diagram and a 
   program that is designed to be used with Panda Simulator running that will
   do this.
