This tutorial shows how we can write publisher and subscriber nodes using C++.
In this very simple example, our publisher can be considered a TALKER node, and
our subscriber can be considered a LISTENER node. As expected we shall be using
our beginner_tutorials package to work on this.

1) Copy and paste the 'listener.cpp' and 'talker.cpp' files from the tutorial
   site, and save them BOTH in the src directory inside beginner_tutorials.
   There is no real need to add many comments about the function calls in this
   write up, as the code is already well commented.

2) Open the CMakeLists.txt file inside the beginner_tutorials directory. At the
   bottom, add the following two lines of code to invoke our subscriber and
   publisher nodes:
   rosbuild_add_executable(talker src/talker.cpp)
   rosbuild_add_executable(listener src/listener.cpp)

   Save the file once the changes have been made.

3) This will now create two executable files from the cpp source code, that go
   inside the bin directory. In the beginner_tutorials directory, run the 'make'
   command.

4) Let us now run our talker and listener to prove they work. For this, we will
   need 3 terminals open.
   i)   In T1, run roscore.
   ii)  In T2, run 'rosrun beginner_tutorials talker' for C++. For Python files,
        you must add the .py file extension at the end due to it being interped.
   iii) In T3, run 'rosrun beginner_tutorials listener'.

   When you are done, use ctrl-c to terminate the listener and talker (publisher
   and subscriber) nodes.
