In order for us to use most of the ROS tools available to us, we must first 
both INSTALL and INITIALISE rosdep. This rosdep package allows us to install
system dependencies for source we want to compile, as well as being VITAL TO RUN
SOME CORE COMPONENTS IN ROS.

Note: Install ROS before installing rosdep.

1) Install: sudo apt-get install python3-rosdep
WARNING: DO NOT TAKE UBUNTU'S ADVICE OF DOWNLOADING rosdep2 instead. 
This will delete everything you have installed already!!!

2) Initialise: sudo rosdep init
               rosdep update
