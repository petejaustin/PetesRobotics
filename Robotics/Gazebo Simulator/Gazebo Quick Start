This tutorial covers the absolute basics of opening a simulation in Gazebo, and
is most likely one of the first experiences many people will have with it.

1) Run gazebo with the 'gazebo' command in Terminal. Once you've seen the empty
   world, feel free to close the program. To safely exit out of Gazebo, use the
   'quit' option in the file menu on the ribbon.

2) Let us actually load a 'world' this time. Using the terminal we ran and then
   closed the empty world gazebo in, type the command: 
   'gazebo worlds/pioneer2dx.world'. If this model is not already installed,
   then gazebo will download it from the online model database.

   World files can be located in the following directory:
   '/usr/share.gazebo-xx/worlds', where xx is the version of Gazebo. For this
   example, the version is 11. If we type 'ls /usr/share.gazebo-11/worlds', we
   shall be given a list of all the worlds saved in this directory.

3) The 'gazebo' command actually does two things: it runs 'gzserver', and then
   'gzclient'. gzserver can be used INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY GUI. gzclient provides
   this interface to the user, giving a visualisation of the simulation.

   Have 2 terminals open, in T1 run 'gzserver', in T2 run 'gzclient'. This will
   let you experiment with how we can open many clients to run on the same serv.
