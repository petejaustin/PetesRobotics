1) Before trying to install the gazebo_ros_pkgs, please first make sure that you
   have installed the FULL version of a ROS desktop package.

2) Ensure that you have ROS Gazebo installed. This can be tested by typing in
   'gazebo' to execute the Gazebo running scripts. If it is not installed,
   install it now.

3) Install gazebo_ros_pkgs using a command with the following syntax:
   'sudo apt-get install ros-distro-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-distro-gazebo-ros-control',
   where you replace distro with whatever ROS distro you are using (melodic,
   noetic, etc). 

   Note: Usually having installed the ROS full package, this may come bundled
   in.

4) Let us now test our ROS integrated Gazebo, and in doing so we will open 3
   terminals.

   i)   In T1 run roscore
   ii)  In T2 run 'rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo'
   iii) To check the ROS connections are fully set up, type 'rostopic list' in
        T3. In the results, we should see topics that have a gazebo directory.
