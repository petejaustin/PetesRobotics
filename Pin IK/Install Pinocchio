1) sudo apt install -qqy lsb-release gnupg2 curl

2) Add robotpkg as a source repository to apt:
   echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/packages/debian/pub $(lsb_release -cs) robotpkg" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/robotpkg.list
   
3) Register authentication certificate of robotpkg:
   curl http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/packages/debian/robotpkg.key | sudo apt-key add -

4) Get package descriptions using 'sudo apt-get update'

5) Install the actual Pinocchio package and its dependencies:
   sudo apt install -qqy robotpkg-py38-pinocchio
   
   NOTE: the 38 in py38 stands for Python version 3.8. This should be set to
   whatever version of Python your machine is running. You can find what 
   version of Python you have by typing 'python --version'.
   
6) Configure the environment variables. Put the following lines inside the
   .bashrc file. There will be a picture in the same directory as this guide
   showing how it should look.
   
   export PATH=/opt/openrobots/bin:$PATH
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/openrobots/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/openrobots/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   export PYTHONPATH=/opt/openrobots/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/openrobots:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
   
   NOTE: On line 4 of the env variables, you'll see python2.7. Change this to
   whatever version of Python your machine is running.
